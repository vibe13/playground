= Project Newcastle (PNC) Alignment with SLSA requirements

This document describes how `Project Newcastle (PNC)` aligns with the SLSA specification. link:https://slsa.dev/[Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)] is a security framework that defines progressive levels of assurance for software supply chains. It provides a common language and set of controls that help organizations demonstrate that software artifacts were built and produced in a trustworthy manner and can be traced back to their origin. The framework is designed to reduce the risk of tampering, unauthorized modification, and supply chain attacks.

We use the SLSA framework as a guide for reinforcing the `PNC` build process, to better secure the Red Hat and IBM software supply chain during the build of Middleware products. 

Our commitment to security means that `PNC` conforms to the link:https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/build-track-basics#build-l3-hardened-builds[SLSA v1.2 Build Level 3] requirements.


== Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) Overview


SLSA organizes requirements into independent *tracks*. Each track addresses a different part of the software lifecycle and defines levels that represent increasing guarantees. This structure allows organizations to incrementally improve assurance in one area independently from the other areas, assessing maturity and communicating compliance transparently.

SLSA relies on several foundational concepts:

* **Artifact** — output produced by a build (e.g., binaries, images)  
* **Provenance** — metadata describing how an artifact was built  
* **Attestation** — cryptographically signed record asserting provenance  
* **Digest** — cryptographic identifier of an artifact  

These mechanisms enable verification that artifacts have not been altered and originate from expected inputs and processes.

== SLSA v1.2
Version 1.2 introduces a major evolution of the specification by expanding beyond build security to include source integrity:

* **Build Track** — assurance that artifacts were built correctly and that provenance describing the build is trustworthy  
* **Source Track** — assurance that the source code and change history are trustworthy and governed by appropriate controls  

The addition of the Source Track makes SLSA a more complete supply chain framework spanning development through build and distribution.

=== Build Track

The Build Track measures confidence in how artifacts are produced and documented through provenance.

Level progression:

|===
| Level | Goal

| L1
| Provenance exists describing the build

| L2
| Provenance is signed and generated by a hosted platform

| L3
| Hardened build platform prevents tampering during builds
|===

These levels primarily address mistakes, post-build tampering, and runtime interference in the build environment. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

=== Source Track

The Source Track measures trust in how source revisions are created and governed. It establishes confidence in repository controls, history integrity, and review practices, enabling consumers to verify whether a revision meets their standards. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

Typical progression includes:

* Version-controlled immutable history  
* Verified change provenance and protections  
* Continuous enforcement of technical controls  
* Two-party review enforcement  

This track addresses threats originating before the build process, such as unauthorized commits or repository misconfiguration. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

== Build isolation

One of the primary responsibilities defined by the SLSA Build Track is ensuring artifacts are produced without unauthorized influence. This is achieved through the use of hosted and isolated build environments that generate trustworthy provenance.

At Build Level 2, builds must execute on a hosted platform that generates signed provenance.  
At Build Level 3, the platform must enforce strong isolation and tamper protections during execution. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

=== Hosted builds

Executing builds on individual workstations introduces inconsistency and risk. Local environments may contain untracked dependencies, configuration drift, or malware that can affect outputs.

SLSA therefore requires builds to run on a hosted build platform rather than developer machines. This reduces attack surface and enables auditing and standardization of build environments. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

{ProductName} satisfies this requirement by operating as a hosted build platform.  
Builds are executed on Amazon Web Services through Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), providing controlled infrastructure with reproducible baseline environments.

This approach supports:

* Consistent build execution  
* Platform-level provenance generation  
* Infrastructure auditability  
* Reduced exposure to workstation compromise  

=== Internal build isolation

While hosted execution protects against local workstation threats, additional safeguards are required to prevent interference within the platform itself.

Build Level 3 emphasizes hardened platforms that:

* Prevent builds from influencing one another  
* Protect signing materials from user workloads  
* Limit cross-tenant or insider tampering  

These controls ensure that forging provenance or altering artifacts requires exploiting platform vulnerabilities rather than simple access or configuration manipulation. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

{ProductName} enforces internal isolation through multiple mechanisms:

* Builds execute in ephemeral pods, preventing persistence between runs  
* Namespaced separation between user workloads and provenance services  
* Tekton Chains signs provenance outside user-controlled execution contexts  

This architecture:

* Prevents environment poisoning across builds  
* Protects attestation signing keys  
* Ensures provenance authenticity  
* Aligns with hardened build platform objectives

== Next steps

The following sections (to be added) map `{ProductName}` capabilities to:

* Build Track requirements  
* Source Track considerations  
* Provenance distribution practices  
* Artifact verification workflows  
* Platform assessment criteria  

These mappings provide traceable evidence of SLSA alignment.
